# Stop At Marker

This is an add-on for Blender, the free and open source 3D creation suite.

## What does it do?

It does what it says on the box: Animation playback is stopped as soon as the playhead hits a marker.

## What is it for?

I use it for creating presentations which are in 3D for no reason at all. Why make ordinary slides when you can have a crazy, all-over-the-place, animated mess instead?

How to use:

1. Install and enable the addon.
2. Animate the camera over your slides/cubes/monkeys.
3. Create a marker for every stop.
4. *Optional*: Change the shortcuts for *Play forwards*/*Play backwards* to `PageDown`/`PageUp` so you can use a presentation clicker.
5. Pretend it's PowerPoint!
